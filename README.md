# Neural Network Project

#### Description

This repository conatins project of an neural network which predicts if incomes are greater or smaller than 50k. The dataset is provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lodetomasi1995/income-classification/data).

#### Data Summary

dataset contain 32 561 records, where each has 14 features:

**income** is the target value and the task for neural network is predict if some person earns more or less than 50k
